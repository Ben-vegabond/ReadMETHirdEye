Greetings! Welcome to my Professional ReadME generator, 
this is a command-line tool designed to streamline the process of creating README file for your future projects. By prompting you with a series of questions, it gathers essential project information such as title, description, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## ü™Ñ User Story

**GIVEN** a command-line application that accepts user input

**WHEN** I am prompted for information about my application repository

**THEN** a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

**WHEN** I enter my project title

**THEN** this is displayed as the title of the README

**WHEN** I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions

**THEN** this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests

**WHEN** I choose a license for my application from a list of options

**THEN** a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

**WHEN** I enter my GitHub username

**THEN** this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile

**WHEN** I enter my email address

**THEN** this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions

**WHEN** I click on the links in the Table of Contents

**THEN** I am taken to the corresponding section of the README


## üåê How to Operate 

1. **Installation**: First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from the official website. Then, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

2. **Install Dependencies**: In the project directory, run the command npm install to install the required dependencies, including inquirer, which is necessary for prompting user input.

3. **Run the Application**: After installing the dependencies, run the command node index.js in the terminal. This will initiate the README Generator and present a series of prompts for you to fill in with information about your project.

4. **Answer the Prompts**: The application will ask you questions about your project, such as the title, description, installation instructions, usage, licenses, and more. Answer each prompt with relevant information.

5. **README Generation**: Once you've completed all the prompts, the application will generate a README.md file based on your responses. The file will be created in the project directory.

6. **Review and Customize**: Open the generated README.md file using a text editor. Review the content and make any additional customizations you desire to ensure the README accurately represents your project.

7. **Usage**: The README.md file is now ready to be included in your project repository on platforms like GitHub. Copy the contents and paste them into your project's README file or create a new one and replace its content with the generated text.

 By following these steps, you can quickly and easily create a professional README for your project, providing essential information to potential users and contributors while maintaining consistency and clarity in your project documentation.



## ‚öôÔ∏èTechnologies Used

ReadMEthirdEye is built with the following technologies:

-**Node.js**: The project is built on Node.js, an open-source JavaScript runtime that allows us to execute JavaScript code outside of the browser.

-**Inquirer.js**: This package is used to create a user-friendly command-line interface and prompt the user with questions to gather project information.

-**File System (fs) module**: The fs module in Node.js is utilized to read and write files, enabling the application to create the README.md file dynamically.

-**JavaScript ES6**: The project uses modern JavaScript features, such as arrow functions, template literals, and const/let declarations.



## üîÆ Future Development

As a new web developer, I am committed to improving and enhancing the user experience. If you have any suggestions, feedback, or encounter any issues, please do not hesitate to contact me.
